            <ul>
                <li>Carl Jung was an early supporter of Freud because of their shared interest in the unconscious.</li>
                <li>He was an active member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society (formerly known as the Wednesday Psychological Society).</li>
                <li>When the International Psychoanalytical Association formed in 1910 Jung became president at the request of Freud.

                </li>
                <li>However in 1912 while on a lecture tour of America Jung publicly criticized Freud’s theory of the Oedipus complex and his emphasis on infantile sexuality. The following year this led to an irrevocable split between them and Jung went on
                    to develop his own version of psychoanalytic theory.</li>
                <li>Most of Jung's assumptions of his analytical psychology reflect his theoretical differences with Freud. For example, while Jung agreed with Freud that a person’s past and childhood experiences determined future behavior, he also believed
                    that we are shaped by our future (aspirations) too.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Theory of Libido: </strong>Jung (1948) disagreed with Freud regarding the role of sexuality. He believed the libido was not just sexual energy, but instead generalized psychic energy.

                </li>
                <li><strong>Theory of the Unconscious:  </strong>Like Freud (and Erikson) Jung regarded the psyche as made up of a number of separate but interacting systems. The three main ones were the ego, the personal unconscious, and the collective unconscious.
                </li>
